# Service Worker 404 Error Fixed

## Issue Description
The application was throwing a service worker registration error in the browser console:
```
Service worker registration failed: TypeError: Failed to register a ServiceWorker for scope ('http://127.0.0.1:5001/') with script ('http://127.0.0.1:5001/sw.js'): A bad HTTP response code (404) was received when fetching the script.
```

## Root Cause
The `static/script.js` file contained code to register a service worker at `/sw.js`, but this file didn't exist in the project:

```javascript
// Service worker registration for offline functionality (optional)
if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
    navigator.serviceWorker.register('/sw.js').catch(err => {
        console.log('Service worker registration failed:', err);
    });
}
```

## Solution Implemented
Removed the service worker registration code since:
1. The `sw.js` file doesn't exist 
2. Service worker functionality is optional for this application
3. The 404 error was causing console spam without providing any benefit

## Changes Made
**File**: `/static/script.js`

**Before:**
```javascript
// Service worker registration for offline functionality (optional)
if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
    navigator.serviceWorker.register('/sw.js').catch(err => {
        console.log('Service worker registration failed:', err);
    });
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Note: Service worker functionality removed to prevent 404 errors
// Can be re-added later if offline functionality is needed
```

## Verification
✅ **Error Resolution**: Service worker 404 error eliminated
✅ **JavaScript Compilation**: No syntax errors in script.js
✅ **Functionality**: All existing chat and real-time features remain functional
✅ **Console Cleanliness**: No more registration error spam

## Future Considerations
If offline functionality is needed in the future, a proper service worker file (`sw.js`) can be created with appropriate caching strategies for:
- Static assets (CSS, JS, images)
- API responses (with appropriate cache invalidation)
- Offline fallback pages

## Impact
- **Positive**: Cleaner console output, no misleading error messages
- **Neutral**: No change to existing functionality 
- **None**: No negative impact on user experience or system performance
